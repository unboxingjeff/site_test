             <div>I am so sorry to hear about the technological limitations. Perhaps you can further show to me how to use Bitcoin to collect the transactions outside of the Website. We can incorporate this into an In-Person Meeting. Both of my hosts have asked that we all eat lunch together. Me, Yourself and Will, the two hosts. This has been a lot of Back-And-Forth for me and I would like to get things squared away. I can cover travel, room, and board if you would oblige to come to Akron. I know the greatest breakfast sandwich place.</div>

                         <div>We can implement the banner ads. We can just have them redirect to the Health Force page. Just in case though, we would actually very much appreciate getting in touch with the show hosts. Aside from the ads, they might have other useful input as to the design of the show page.<br></div>

                         <div>Unfortunately, we cannot use any data-collecting service if we are hosting a static website. Even if you want to use bitcoin, you would still need to collect purchaser data via email.</div>

                               <div>I am very happy about the near completion of the Website. Please keep the Banner Ads. I feel that the hosts will support them most assuredly. I could loop them in if you would prefer. As for the transactions, could Will and yourself leverage Bitcoin or the Blockchain? I am happy to pay extra for this functionality (only from you) but I like to keep a small Circle of Trust.</div>

                                     <div><br></div>
                                     <div>Glad we could work this out. I think we are almost at a point to settle on a fee and get started.</div>

                                     <div>Firstly, Will and I want to once again emphasize: the banner ads are intrusive and unnecessary. We both believe they only serve to drive away your customers considering your product will be advertised in the show. I strongly recommend consulting with your hosts, I'm sure they will agree.</div>
                                     <div><br></div>
                                     <div>Secondly, please use one of the previously listed e-commerce providers. Because the website will be completely static, you will have to conduct these transactions via phone or mailed check. We would be happy to integrate e-commerce for you but it will cost money.</div>
